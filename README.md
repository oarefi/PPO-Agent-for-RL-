# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for MountainCar-v0


This repository contains an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm applied to the "MountainCar-v0" environment from OpenAI's Gym library. PPO is a reinforcement learning algorithm used to train agents in various environments, and in this case, it is used to teach an agent to solve the challenging MountainCar task.


In this project, we employ the PPO algorithm to train an agent to master the MountainCar-v0 environment. The agent learns to control a car to reach the flag at the top of the hill, a classic problem in reinforcement learning. The code provides both the training process and a visualization of the trained agent's performance.

train_ppo.py: This script trains the agent using the PPO algorithm. You can modify hyperparameters and training settings within the script.

visualize_agent.py: After training, you can use this script to visualize the trained agent's performance. It will generate an MP4 video of the agent's actions in the environment.

Results
The trained agent learns to navigate the challenging MountainCar environment and eventually reaches the flag at the top of the hill. You can find a sample video of the agent's performance in the trained_agent.mp4 file.
